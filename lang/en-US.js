      benefits: "What is the benefits of thermal underwear?",
      benAnswer: [
        "Thermal underwear is a two-piece garment that is worn as a bottom and top to keep the body warm in wind, fog, sleet or harsh snow. This garment is normally long to the feet and long sleeved to the ankles and is worn by direct skin contact. It traps body heat to provide warmth to the body. The two pieces of the thermal suit are independent of each other, so you can choose to wear the top or bottom as per need",
        "Thermal underwear is normally long to the feet and long sleeves to the ankles, but it does not appeal to women who love to wear dresses such as short undershirts and short sleeve blouses. But now, Halis Termal creates different styles that fit well with any garment. There is now the option to choose short undershirts and sleeveless thermal underwear. It is a great way for professional women to stay comfortably warm where they cannot wear long sleeves jackets or blouses. Men can also wear short sleeves or sleeveless thermal clothing under casual clothes such as T-shirts."

      fabrics: "Which fabrics being used to make a thermal underwear?",
      fabAnswer: [
        "Both natural and synthetic fabrics are used to produce thermal underwear. Wool and cotton fabrics have long been used to produce clothing for the winter season because these natural materials have excellent strength to keep warmth. Today, synthetics such as polypropylene, polyester and nylon are also used. However, most thermal suits are made from a mixture of natural and synthetic fabrics. 100% natural wool and cotton clothes absorb moisture and when sweaty wet clothes remain on the skin for a long time, it causes people to become sick again. For this reason, thermal fabric mixtures resulting from scientific research and development studies trap moisture and dry instantly. The garment doesn't stay wet and keeps people warm."
